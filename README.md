Goodies for xkcd 1350: Lorenz

Let the browser visit random stories for you

Memorize paths automaticaly


Lorenz.js
---------

This a greasemonkey script: install it in firefox (there are probably ways to run it in chrome either -- I never tried). This script adds a few buttons to the xkcd/1150 page.

*Random Story*: follow random links until no more option is available

*Run 20 times*: The same, but you don't have to re-click the button to get a new story, the script rolls back and finds a new one for you :)

*Export*: every "automated" story is remembered in the local browser memory. Export would dump all the data to the textarea below if you want to use it in another application....



view.html
---------

Is another application to visualize memory dumps! Paste your exported text, click the button, and you have for each path the depth (number of frames/ choices) and the text of each choice.
